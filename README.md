# Zamzam International

## Trusted Visa service agency

This responsive project provides a number of visas which you can apply for. It also has [Firebase Authentication System](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0) for better user experience. You can create an account using email and password or Google. There is a card for each visa and by clicking the book button, if you are logged in, you go to the booking page and you can pay with credit card and apply for it. Your booking data will be saved to the database [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/). You can also give a review form the review page. Through the admin page, you are allowed to add and delete any service and make another admin through the make admin page. You can see all the orders that you have made on our website in the booking list page and if you are an admin, you can see all the orders that have been made by the users and edit the status of any visa order that a user has applied for. Last but not least, this website uses private routing form [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form validation.
